# Server Side Calculator

## Description

_Duration: Weekend Sprint_

This project is still in production, but the goal is to create a server side calculator. On the front end, users interface with a client side HTML that receives two number inputs, firstNumber and secondNumber. Users can select from 4 operation buttons to choose what they want to do to their first number. When a user clicks "=", the answer to their calcualtion is rendered to the DOM, and the calculation history is displayed in a calculation history div element on the DOM.

On the server side, the history of calculations is stored as an array.

### Prerequisites
